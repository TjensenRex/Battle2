# Battle2
This is a Python version of a little project I wrote up in my free time to see how far I could get with what I've learned in C++. If you'd like to look it over and suggest ways I could expand/improve it, I would be very grateful. I know there's a lot more I can learn, but I'm just not sure where to go from here.
